# UFOs Analysis 

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to allow users to drill down into data on UFO sightings and use the table of data to gain insights via exploratory analysis. 

## Results
There are 5 different filters that users can use to filter the UFO sightings data. They are as follows: 
- Date of the sighting 
- City
- State 
- Country
- Shape of the UFO 

To perform a search, use the webpage (index.html), and enter your desired search criteria into the text boxes and press enter.

## Summary 
One drawback of the webpage is that it would be easier to explore the data and gain insights via a visualization instead of a table. 

Future iterations of the webpage could include visualizations of the data in javascript and a filter for the comments section to see if there are any common patterns in terms of the comments made.
