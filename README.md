# UFOs Analysis 

## Overview
The purpose of the project is to allow users to filter UFO sightings data and gain insights via exploratory analysis. 

## Results
There are 5 different filters that users can use to filter the UFO sightings data. They are as follows: 
- Date of the sighting 
- City
- State 
- Country
- Shape of the UFO 

To search for UFO sightings, download all the files and use the webpage (index.html). Enter your desired search criteria into the text boxes. Press enter after you are done entering each search criteria e.g. us for *country*.

## Summary 
One drawback of the webpage is that it would be easier to explore the data and gain insights via a visualization instead of a table. 

Future iterations of the webpage could include visualizations of the data in javascript and a filter for the comments section to see if there are any common patterns in terms of the comments made.
